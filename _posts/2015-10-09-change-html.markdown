So, you want to mess with websites? It's actually really easy!
Soon you will be messing with pages in no time!

First you need to open your browser's developer tools. To open your browser's developer tools, press one of the following key shortcuts:

* Google Chrome:
    * Windows: F12
    * Mac: &#8984; + &#8997; + I
* Mozilla Firefox:
    * Windows: F12
    * Mac: &#8984; + &#8997; + I
    
If your browser or operating system is not listed here, just do a quick Google Search for it.

Next, click the "Inspect Element" button in the top left.

* Google Chrome:

Next, click on a page element. Then, a line of code will be highlighted.
You can change the code to your heart's content.

Congratulations! You have changed your first web page!
Please note that when you refresh the page all of your changes will be deleted!
You can save your changes by right-clinking and selecting "Save-As."
